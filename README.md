# PHYS_T480

This is the repository for PHYS T480/580 "Big Data Physics: Methods of Machine Learning" at Drexel University, taught by Prof. Gordon Richards.

The course is a series of jupyter notebooks, where I have drawn heavily from resources from
Zeljko Ivezic (University of Washington) -- the lead author of the textbook that we use (http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10159.html)
Andy Connolly (University of Washington), particularly http://cadence.lsst.org/introAstroML/
Karen Leighly (University of Oklahoma), particularly http://http://seminar.ouml.org/
Adam Miller (Northwestern University), https://github.com/LSSTC-DSFP/LSSTC-DSFP-Sessions/
Jo Bovy (University of Toronto), http://astro.utoronto.ca/~bovy/teaching.html

My thanks also to Maher Harb (Drexel University) and Kevin Footer (Deloitte).

I have tried to be careful about properly attributing anything drawn from these resources, but if it isn't clear where something comes from, it is probably there.
Others are welcome to draw from here for their own Machine Learning courses under the MIT license terms.  Please send any corrections to gtr@physics.drexel.edu.
