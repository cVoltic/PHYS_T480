    "$AR$ and $ARMA$ models assume evenly sampled time-series data.  However, we can extend this to unevenly sampled data with $CAR$ or $CARMA$ processes, where the $C$ stands for *continuous*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A $CAR(1)$ process is described by a stochastic differential equation which includes a damping term that pushes $y(t)$ back towards the mean, so it is also a **damped random walk (DRW)**.  For evenly sampled data a CAR(1) process is the same as an AR(1) process with $a_1=\\exp(-1/\\tau)$.  That is, the next value is the previous value times the damping factor (plus noise).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ACF for a DRW is given by\n",
    "$$ ACF(t) = \\exp(-t/\\tau),$$\n",
    "where $\\tau$ is the characteristic timescale (i.e., the damping timescale).\n",

    "The structure function can be written as\n",

With our model and model parameters, we can predict future values via regression, or look for similarities/differences as a function of the model parameters via clustering (unsupervised) or classification (supervised).  Similarly, we can apply dimensionality reduction techniques to help visualize results from high-dimensional models."
